## HCI[f]: Learning Computer Science through Augmented Reality with CODA ##
### Final project prototype for CISC482/CISC682 (Fall '19) by Kate Bagshaw, Minji Kong, and Erin O'Connor ###

With the recent rise in demand for Computer Science education, there has been various novice programming environments developed to make an introductory programmer's learning experience easy and approachable. One of the most widely recognized environments, ScratchJR, holds many limitations in terms of factors such as interactivity and accessibility. 

To further enhance one's introductory programming experience in environments such as ScratchJR, the HCI[f] team introduces CODA, an Augmented Reality (AR)-based block-based programming application. With our Android-friendly mobile setup, users can learn how to create an AR face with a step-by-step block programming approach. 

This repository stores the final Unity prototype package of CODA for the CISC582/CISC682 (F19) project submission. The package includes the .apk file that can be used for execution.
